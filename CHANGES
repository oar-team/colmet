Version 0.3.0
-------------

- Divided colmet package into three parts

  - colmet-node : Retrieve data from taskstats and procstats and send to
    collectors with ZeroMQ
  - colmet-collector : A collector that stores data received by ZeroMQ in a
    hdf5 file
  - colmet-common : Common colmet part.
- Added some parameters of ZeroMQ backend to prevent a memory overflow

  counters that colmet should queue in memory before pushing it to output
  backend
